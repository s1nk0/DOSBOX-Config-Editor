# DOSBOX-Config-Editor

![](https://i.imgur.com/WlH8p9R.png)

Small, light program for Windows to edit your dosbox.conf file. Built with latest version 0.74-3

This is a program I've always wanted to make when I started playing DOS games with DOSBox. I didn't want to fiddle with the conf in a text editor anymore. :)
